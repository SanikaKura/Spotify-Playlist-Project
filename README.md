# Spotify-Playlist-Project
This project was designed to help users find niche, 'underground', music that fits their personal taste. My program uses the spotify API to grab a user's top 10 songs from the past six months and find recommendations based on these tracks, searching only for songs below a certain popularity ranking. It then creates a playlist on the user's spotify account with these 20 recommendations, helping the user discover new songs and artists that might be relatively undiscovered.

Here you can see the HTML page which prompts the user to log in with their spotify account. Once the user enters their information, the page shows the album art of the first four tracks on their new playlist, as well as a message letting them know that their playlist is ready to go!

This is what the user would see on their spotify home page when they run this program:
